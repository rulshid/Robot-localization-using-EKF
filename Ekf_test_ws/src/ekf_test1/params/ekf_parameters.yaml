# [ADVANCED] When measuring one pose variable with two sensors, a situation can arise in which both sensors under-
# report their covariances. This can lead to the filter rapidly jumping back and forth between each measurement as they
# arrive. In these cases, it often makes sense to (a) correct the measurement covariances, or (b) if velocity is also
# measured by one of the sensors, let one sensor measure pose, and the other velocity. However, doing (a) or (b) isn't
# always feasible, and so we expose the differential parameter. When differential mode is enabled, all absolute pose
# data is converted to velocity data by differentiating the absolute pose measurements. These velocities are then
# integrated as usual. NOTE: this only applies to sensors that provide pose measurements; setting differential to true
# for twist measurements has no effect.
odom0_differential: false

# [ADVANCED] When the node starts, if this parameter is true, then the first measurement is treated as a "zero point"
# for all future measurements. While you can achieve the same effect with the differential paremeter, the key
# difference is that the relative parameter doesn't cause the measurement to be converted to a velocity before
# integrating it. If you simply want your measurements to start at 0 for a given sensor, set this to true.

# [ADVANCED] The process noise covariance matrix can be difficult to tune, and can vary for each application, 
#so it is exposed as a configuration parameter. 
#This matrix represents the noise we add to the total error after each prediction step. 

# The better the omnidirectional motion model matches your system, the smaller these values can be. 
#However, if users find that a given variable is slow to converge, one approach is to increase the 
#process_noise_covariance diagonal value for the variable in question, which will cause the filter's predicted error to be larger, 
#which will cause the filter to trust the incoming measurement more during correction. 

# The values are ordered as x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, vx, vy, vz, vroll, vpitch, vyaw, ax, ay, az. 
# Defaults to the matrix below if unspecified.
